            <h2>The significance of Muslim community in my life</h2>

            <p>Growing up in a religious Muslim family, Muslim community has had influenced my personal perspectives, and traditions. One of the examples would be considering something whether it is halal or haram. This is just few parts of my religious activity, but I believe and value equally in every other Islamic activity. One of the other activity, I started fasting at the age of eleven. From my very early age, I have seen my family, around the muslim society value of Islam has been very meaningful and important. I have seen praying five times a day, hosting Islamic events, fasting, following the path of halal, and so much that reminds me who exactly I am. People might think Islam religion has various kinds of rules and regulations, so it will be hard. But the fact that it is not hard. The joy of following the Islamic path is really precious, it is like one step at a time by completing goals. For example, completing the daily goals as praying five times, and completing monthly goal as the month of Ramadan. No other work is easier unless, we work for it. Muslim community is important to me and the fact that I will perform every other Islamic activity for the rest of my life.</p>

            <h3>Life Lately</h3>
            <p>While everyone is writing their own narrative poem,</p>
            <p>typing something into keyboard, or at least thinking what to write,</p>
            <p>there he is worrying about the other projects,</p>
            <p>even though knowing very well writing is his weakness.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Time is ticking, everyone is rushing,</p>
            <p>and he is there figuring his problem that he is lost.</p>
            <p>Thinking and thinking deeply, lost is not the issue:</p>
            <p>it is overthinking.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Some of the reasons are valid,</p>
            <p>as the feeling of getting projects in the first week of semester.</p>
            <p>Others are blurry, as what if the major he is studying would not work out in the future</p>
            <p>or if the dot of his life would never connect,</p>
            <p>and so, the path of his success remains incomplete.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Time is ticking, everyone is rushing,</p>
            <p>and he is pretending as everything are just fine.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While everyone is writing their own narrative poem,</p>
            <p>he is wondering, he is the author, the rule maker of his life,</p>
            <p>then why not choosing relaxing for a while by writing poem over freaking out?</p>
            <p>he starts his poem by telling his side of story,</p>
            <p>and pretends he was never lost.</p>

            <h3>Sweet Dream</h3>
            <p>He remembers days were gone by,</p>
            <p>when soccer ball and cricket bat were his guys,</p>
            <p>with friends by his side, they'd reach the sky,</p>
            <p>but now it seems,</p>
            <p>those days were just a little dream.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>With every goal, and every wicket,</p>
            <p>they laughed and played, no need to care,</p>
            <p>but now it seems, those days aren't there,</p>
            <p>and he cries and wishes to live in the past.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In this rush world, where time flies fast,</p>
            <p>those memories of play will never last,</p>
            <p>but he hopes, will forever last,</p>
            <p>and his heart aches for the past,</p>
            <p>and those days of sport, will always be a part of his past.</p>

            <h3>Save Nature</h3>
            <p>This Mother Earth,</p>
            <p>who gives us life.</p>
            <p>This Mother Earth,</p>
            <p>heart filled with strife.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Broken bottles and charred pieces of glass,</p>
            <p>wadded up newspapers tossed on the grass,</p>
            <p>pouring of concrete and tearing out trees.</p>
            <p>This is the environment that surrounds me?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Look outside, see the trees,watch the flowers in the breeze.</p>
            <p>Things won't be like this in a year or two,</p>
            <p>if polluting is all we do.</p>
            <p> </p>

            <h3>Final Week</h3>
            <p>Students rush around to move out, as done with finals,</p>
            <p>Empty halls and empty grounds,</p>
            <p>Memories we will hold! </p>
            <p> </p>
